# Hack-Manchester-Jnr-2018
Our entry to the Avecto challenge at Hack Manchester Junior 2018. For this we created a multiplayer web game based off Yu-Gi-Oh! but instead of monsters we used common cyber security threats instead. This was one of the more enjoyable hackathons as the team was also great and the challenge was interesting.
## Technology Used:
* NodeJS - For the backend and serving up the HTML pages
* KonvaJS - Wrapper around the Canvas API, this made the process of creating the game elements much less torturous
* Socket.io - For Websocket integration to allow realtime communication between the client and server

Please note that this was the first time that I used many of the libraries and technologies, with that in mind the solutions to several of the problems are probably really inefficient, I will at some point get around to refactoring it.
